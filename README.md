Radiance is a production-grade node pack for ComfyUI built around 32-bit float and HDR/ACES image pipelines. It brings VFX plate prep, color management, review tooling, in-canvas studio dashboards, and Nuke / DaVinci Resolve handoff into one coherent toolkit, so you can take a shot from generation through finishing without leaving the graph.

Artists get 32-bit, HDR, and ACES image tools, professional viewers, and VFX nodes. Supervisors and coordinators get project, shot, asset, and workflow management built directly into the canvas.

## Overview

- 32-bit float and EXR workflows for VFX and finishing, with lossless scene-linear round-trips.
- ACES, OCIO, log curves, LUTs, CDL, scopes, QC, and grade-transfer tools.
- VFX utilities for plate prep, masks, depth, camera and optics, motion, multipass, real AOV ingestion, and relighting.
- Video and temporal workflow nodes for loading, routing, conditioning, sampling, and delivery.
- In-canvas studio dashboards (Project Manager, Workflow Library, Assets) rendered over the ComfyUI graph, never in a separate browser tab.
- **Radiance Sampler**, a preset-driven sampler that hides irrelevant parameters and adapts to the selected model.
- One **Viewer** with a Simple mode (picture, compare, playback) and an Advanced mode (scopes, grade, inspector, timeline tools), and keyboard shortcuts.
- HDR VAE Encode / Decode that carry values above 1.0 through the model's VAE, learned SDR → HDR recovery (RUDRA), and HDR LoRA tooling for scene-linear generation.
- Dynamic Gizmos: collapse any group of nodes into a single reusable custom node.
- Secure-by-default handoff to Nuke and DaVinci Resolve.

## In action

**The Radiance Viewer**: WebGPU-accelerated review at FP32/RGBA32F end to end: EXR channel and layer inspection, OpenColorIO 2.5 (load a show's config and the Display and View menus come from it, applied through OCIO's own GPU path), with a built-in ACES 1.3 pipeline as the fallback, exposure/tone/colour controls with lift-gamma-gain wheels, scopes (histogram, waveform, vectorscope, parade) with selectable scales (10-bit and 12-bit code value, percent, mV, and nits for ST.2084 and HLG), data or video levels, and a switch for whether they measure before or after the viewer colour transforms, a pixel probe with per-region min/max/mean/median and NaN/Inf reporting, false colour, zebra, a nit-accurate HDR heatmap anchored to BT.2408 reference white, safe areas labelled with the standard they come from (SMPTE ST 2046-1 / EBU R 95), aspect-ratio mattes, nearest-neighbour magnification on N, timecode, A/B compare with wipe, difference and blink, and a sequence timeline with per-frame thumbnails.

</div>

**A generation-to-review graph**: Loader → Prompt → Resolution → Sampler → VAE Decode (HDR) in Direct HDR mode → Viewer. The decode stays scene-linear the whole way; the Viewer applies the display transform, so what you grade is what the file actually contains.

## Installation

### ComfyUI Manager / Comfy Registry

Search for **Radiance** in ComfyUI Manager, or install it from the Comfy Registry.
Nothing else needs doing:

- **Dependencies** install from `requirements.txt` (OpenColorIO, OpenEXR,
  OpenImageIO, OpenCV and the rest; all ship as wheels for Python 3.9 to
  3.13). On Python 3.14, which has no OpenEXR wheel yet, OpenEXR is skipped
  and EXR goes through OpenImageIO.
- **OCIO** configures itself at startup: your `$OCIO` if you have one,
  otherwise OpenColorIO's built-in ACES studio config. No files to download.
- **The RUDRA SDR → HDR model** downloads the first time a graph needs it
  (about 5 MB, see [Models](#models-rudra-sdr--hdr)).
- **The Multipass Estimate models** (MoGe-2 and Marigold IID, about 4.9 GB)
  download the first time that node runs, unless its
  `download_missing_models` switch is off (see
  [Multipass Estimate](#models-multipass-estimate)).

Checked on a clean ComfyUI 0.32 with Python 3.13: the registry package
installs, all 156 nodes load, OCIO is configured, and the first SDR → HDR run
fetches the model and applies it.

### Requirements

Install into the **same Python environment as ComfyUI**. Radiance relies on ComfyUI's existing PyTorch. Dependencies are pure Python (no CUDA toolkit or compiler required). Use the requirements file that matches your platform, shown below.

### Windows

```bat
cd ComfyUI\custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/fxtdstudios/radiance.git
cd radiance
pip install -r requirements_windows.txt
```

### Ubuntu / Linux

Install the system libraries OpenCV needs (OpenEXR and OCIO ship as self-contained wheels):

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git python3-venv build-essential libgl1 libglib2.0-0 ffmpeg
```

> On Ubuntu 22.04 the package is `libgl1-mesa-glx`; on 24.04+ it's `libgl1`.

Then, inside ComfyUI's environment:

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/fxtdstudios/radiance.git
cd radiance
pip install -r requirements_linux.txt
```

### WSL (Ubuntu on Windows)

WSL2 is Ubuntu with GPU passthrough, so follow the Ubuntu steps above (including `requirements_linux.txt`), plus:

- Install the NVIDIA driver on the **Windows host only**, never a Linux NVIDIA driver inside WSL. Verify with `nvidia-smi` inside WSL.
- No CUDA Toolkit needed: PyTorch's bundled CUDA runtime handles the GPU.
- Keep ComfyUI on the Linux filesystem (`~/ComfyUI`), not `/mnt/c/...`, for speed; open the UI from Windows at `http://localhost:8188`.

### macOS (Apple Silicon)

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/fxtdstudios/radiance.git
cd radiance
pip install -r requirements_mac_silicon.txt
```

### Verify

Start ComfyUI and look for `Radiance: successfully loaded 156 nodes (v3.5.0)` in the log.
A lower count means a node module failed to import, usually a missing optional
dependency; the Environment Guard table printed at startup shows which.

For a full machine-level check (every node executed on your GPU, VRAM peaks,
and the RUDRA SDR → HDR pixel model benchmarked and scored), run the
acceptance tool. It ships with a git install, not with the registry package:

```bat
cd ComfyUI
python custom_nodes\radiance\tools\gpu_acceptance.py
```

It writes `gpu_acceptance_report.md` next to the script, and names any nodes
missing on your install.

### Updating

- **ComfyUI Manager / Registry:** use *Update* on Radiance in the Manager, then restart ComfyUI.
- **Git install:** `git pull` in `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/radiance`, run the same
  `pip install -r ...` line as above, then restart ComfyUI.

The startup log prints the installed version:
`Radiance: successfully loaded 156 nodes (v3.5.0)`.

### Upgrading from 2.x or 3.4

3.5.0 is a large release; the full list is in the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md#350---2026-09-24).
What affects an existing graph:

- **Check widget values once on HDR VAE Decode, SDR → HDR Universal, SDR → HDR
  Recover and NDI Sender.** Inputs were removed from them, and ComfyUI stores
  widget values by position.
- **HDR is measured one way everywhere:** linear 1.0 = reference white, 203
  nits by default (ITU-R BT.2408). Universal and Recover output that used 1.0 =
  100 nits is now 2.03x smaller in value and identical in nits.
- **Learned SDR → HDR is one pixel model** that downloads itself; the older
  latent decoders (`rudra_turbo_decoder_*`, `rudra_full_decoder_*`) are no
  longer read and can be deleted from `models/radiance`.
- **To carry HDR through a VAE, use VAE Encode (HDR)** with VAE Decode (HDR).
  HDR Latent Encoder and HDR Turbo Encoder are retired: nothing decodes their
  latents back to HDR any more. They are gone from the menu, and a saved graph
  that uses one still opens but stops with a message to swap in VAE Encode
  (HDR). ACES 2.0 Output Transform (Legacy) is also off the menu; it still
  works in saved graphs, and ACES 2.0 Output Transform replaces it.
- **SAM Loader and SAM Mask Generator** no longer pretend to segment; use a SAM2
  node pack and feed its mask into Radiance.
- **Multipass Extract is retired; use Multipass Estimate.** Its material and
  lighting passes were image filters, not measurements. A saved graph that
  uses it still opens and stops with a message naming the replacement.
  Multipass Estimate has different outputs (no emission, transmission,
  reflection mask, segmentation ID or highpass), so reconnect them.
- **Multipass Relight reads `ao` the way renderers write it: 1 = open.** It
  used to read the pass as an occlusion amount, which inverted real AO loaded
  through Read AOVs. A hand-made occlusion mask needs inverting once.
- **Thirteen bug fixes change some outputs:** Video HDR Decode (white on
  `peak_nits`, a real SDR preview), Video Batch Decode (no second
  `latent_scale`), HDR Color Pipeline (every primaries pair, corrected D60
  matrices), Multipass Relight's point light with a depth pass, Digital
  Cinema Read (a video's first frame), EXR MultiPart (every frame). The
  changelog's upgrade note lists them.

### Models (RUDRA SDR → HDR)

Learned SDR → HDR recovery uses the **RUDRA** pixel model: a compact network
that takes decoded 8-bit SDR pixels and returns scene-linear HDR, recovering
clipped highlights and crushed shadows. It works on any image or frame batch
and needs no VAE, so it applies equally to generated frames and to footage.
The weights are published on Hugging Face,
[fxtdstudios/RUDRA](https://huggingface.co/fxtdstudios/RUDRA).

**The RUDRA weights are licensed for non-commercial use only**, unlike
Radiance's code (GPL-3.0) and RUDRA's code (Apache 2.0). One training source
(HdM-HDR-2014 / HdM-HFR-2017) is free for academic use only, and FXTD Studios
cannot waive that term. Research, evaluation, teaching and personal projects
are fine; commercial production, client deliverables and paid services need a
commercial licence from [FXTD Studios](https://fxtdstudios.com). The full
terms are in the weights'
[licence](https://huggingface.co/fxtdstudios/RUDRA/blob/main/LICENSE). Expand
mode uses no weights and has no such restriction.

**It downloads automatically.** The first time SDR → HDR Universal or
SDR → HDR Recover needs the model and none is installed, Radiance fetches
RUDRA's shipped model, `sdr2hdr_shadow_v1` (about 5 MB), into your ComfyUI
models folder:

```
ComfyUI/models/radiance/sdr2hdr_shadow_v1.safetensors
```

The download is pinned to a fixed Hugging Face commit and checked by size and
SHA-256 before it is used; a file that does not match is discarded. It happens
once, and the console shows `[Radiance] Installed ...` when it is done. Leave
the node's `pixel_checkpoint` field empty to use it.

To install it by hand instead (offline or air-gapped machines), download
[`sdr2hdr_shadow_v1.safetensors`](https://huggingface.co/fxtdstudios/RUDRA/resolve/main/sdr2hdr/sdr2hdr_shadow_v1.safetensors)
and put it at the path above, creating the `radiance` folder if needed. To turn
automatic downloads off, set any of these in the ComfyUI launch environment:

| Variable | Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| `RADIANCE_ALLOW_DOWNLOADS=0` | never download any Radiance model |
| `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1` or `TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE=1` | treat the machine as offline |

Radiance registers `models/radiance` with ComfyUI, so a `radiance:` entry in
`extra_model_paths.yaml` works too, and `RADIANCE_SDR2HDR_PIXEL` can point at
a file anywhere. Every RUDRA image checkpoint loads, as Hugging Face publishes
it (`.safetensors`, flat in the folder or under the `sdr2hdr/` subfolder
`hf download` creates) or as the training scripts write it (`.pt`); each file
carries its own architecture, so the shadow-gated and ungated models both
build correctly. When several are present `sdr2hdr_shadow_v1` wins, then the
other shadow seeds, then `sdr2hdr_image_v5`, then older `.pt` files.
`sdr2hdr_temporal_v1` is not an image model and is refused with a message
saying so.

| File | Used by | Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `sdr2hdr_shadow_v1.safetensors` | SDR → HDR Universal (Recover / Hybrid) and SDR → HDR Recover, stills and frame batches | [download](https://huggingface.co/fxtdstudios/RUDRA/resolve/main/sdr2hdr/sdr2hdr_shadow_v1.safetensors) (auto) |
| `sdr2hdr_shadow_s2` / `_s3`, `sdr2hdr_image_v5` / `_v6` | alternatives: other seeds of the shipped recipe, and the backbone without the shadow gate | [RUDRA/sdr2hdr](https://huggingface.co/fxtdstudios/RUDRA/tree/main/sdr2hdr) |
| `temporal_rudra_residual_ema.safetensors` | the motion-aligned temporal model for ordered video (optional) | not yet published |

If the model can't be found or downloaded, Universal falls back to
deterministic expansion and says so in its `report` output; Recover raises
rather than silently expanding.

**What the model recovers, and what it doesn't.** In clipped highlights the
network supplies brightness; the colour stays the source's. A clipped channel
carries no information about its own value, and the released checkpoints were
trained on renders that almost never clipped, so their per-channel guesses in
blown areas are not reliable colour: letting them through drew false-colour
rings round a clipped sun and cast white areas red. The learned lift fades in
as the source goes to white (two or more channels near clip), is never darker
than the deterministic expansion, and no channel of it exceeds `peak_nits`,
so an HDR10 encode cannot clip it per channel. The model runs on the whole
frame when it fits in memory; `pixel_tile_size` only applies when it does
not, because the network normalises over its input and tiles shift the
result.

### Models every other node downloads

Every node that needs a model downloads it the first time it runs. Each file
is pinned (a fixed Hugging Face commit or the original release file) and its
SHA-256 is checked before it is installed; a file that does not match is
deleted. Downloads go to a `.part` file and resume after an interruption, and
ComfyUI's progress bar shows them.

| Node | Model | Size | From | Installed to |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Upscale Image / Video, Tier 1 | Real-ESRGAN x4+, x2+, x4+ anime | 18-67 MB | [xinntao/Real-ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN/releases) | `models/upscale_models/` |
| Upscale Image / Video, Tier 2 | SwinIR-L x4 real-world GAN | 142 MB | [JingyunLiang/SwinIR](https://github.com/JingyunLiang/SwinIR/releases) | `models/upscale_models/` |
| Upscale Image / Video, Tier 3 | SD x4 upscaler (diffusers) | 3.5 GB | [stabilityai/stable-diffusion-x4-upscaler](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-x4-upscaler) | Hugging Face cache |
| Upscale Face Restore | CodeFormer, GFPGAN 1.4, RetinaFace | 110-377 MB | original GitHub releases | `models/facerestore_models/`, `models/facedetection/` |
| AI Upscale | SUPIR v0F / v0Q (fp16), Real-ESRGAN | 2.7 GB each | [Kijai/SUPIR_pruned](https://huggingface.co/Kijai/SUPIR_pruned) | `models/upscale_models/` |
| Depth Map Generator | Depth Anything V2 Small / Base / Large | 99 MB-1.3 GB | [depth-anything](https://huggingface.co/depth-anything) | Hugging Face cache |
| Read Models (`auto_download`) | the 60 checkpoints, text encoders and VAEs in its presets (FLUX.1 / FLUX.2 / klein, SDXL, LTX-2.3 / 2.5, MiniMax-H3) | 4 MB-66 GB | pinned Hugging Face commits | the matching `models/` folder |

**Gated repositories.** FLUX.2-dev, FLUX.2-klein 9B and LTX-2.5 require
accepting their licence on Hugging Face. Accept it on the model page, set
`HF_TOKEN` to a read token (or run `huggingface-cli login`) and restart
ComfyUI; the download then runs automatically. Without the token the node
stops with a message giving both steps.

**Installed by hand.** HAT-L (Upscale Tier 2) is published only on Google
Drive, so there is no pinned download: get it from the
[HAT page](https://github.com/XPixelGroup/HAT#how-to-test) and save it as
`models/upscale_models/HAT_L_x4.pth` / `HAT_L_x2.pth`. Until then Tier 2
uses SwinIR-L at 4x and Real-ESRGAN at 2x. SeedVR2 needs the
ComfyUI-SeedVR2_VideoUpscaler node pack, which fetches its own weights.

The latent-space RUDRA decoders that earlier releases loaded inside HDR VAE
Decode (`rudra_turbo_decoder_*` / `rudra_full_decoder_*`) were retired in
3.5.0; see the changelog. The files can be deleted from `models/radiance`.

### Models (Multipass Estimate)

Multipass Estimate turns a plate into render-style passes using trained
models only; every pass is a prediction of that quantity or is computed from
one. It downloads its weights the first time it runs, pinned to fixed Hugging
Face commits:

| Model | Passes | Size | Licence | Installed to |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [MoGe-2 ViT-L](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/MoGe) (Microsoft) | depth (metres), world position, normals; AO and curvature computed from them | 662 MB | MIT | `models/geometry_estimation/moge_2_vitl_normal_fp16.safetensors` |
| [Marigold IID Appearance v1.1](https://huggingface.co/prs-eth/marigold-iid-appearance-v1-1) (ETH Zurich) | albedo, roughness, metallic | 2.5 GB | OpenRAIL++-M | `models/radiance/marigold/iid-appearance-v1-1/` |
| [Marigold IID Lighting v1.1](https://huggingface.co/prs-eth/marigold-iid-lighting-v1-1) | diffuse and specular lighting | 1.7 GB | OpenRAIL++-M | `models/radiance/marigold/iid-lighting-v1-1/` |

MoGe-2 runs through ComfyUI's native MoGe support, so it needs a ComfyUI that
has the MoGe nodes; a model from **Load MoGe Model** can also be connected.
The Marigold licence allows commercial use with the use restrictions in its
[licence](https://huggingface.co/prs-eth/marigold-iid-appearance-v1-1/blob/main/LICENSE).
To install by hand, download the files into the folders above. Set the node's
`download_missing_models` off, or `RADIANCE_ALLOW_DOWNLOADS=0`, to stop the
download.

What the passes are, and what they are not:

- **Geometry is metric but estimated.** Depth and position are in metres in
  camera space (OpenGL axes, the camera looks down -z), with the field of view
  recovered from the image unless you give it. Scale is the model's estimate,
  usually within about 10 to 20 percent indoors. Sky and other pixels without
  a surface are 0 in depth and position and 0 in `geometry_mask`.
- **AO and curvature are computed, not guessed.** AO is the GTAO integral
  (cosine-weighted, radius in metres) over the estimated geometry, 1 = open.
  Curvature is mean curvature in 1/metre, convex positive.
- **Materials and lighting are learned decompositions.** Diffuse and specular
  lighting are scaled to the plate by a least-squares fit per frame, and the
  node's `info` output reports how closely they add back up to the beauty
  (about 10 percent RMS on an indoor photo). Every colour pass is
  scene-linear.
- **Motion vectors** are measured with DIS optical flow: backward, in pixels,
  +y up.
- **Video is per frame.** The models see one frame at a time; a fixed seed
  limits flicker but does not remove it.
- **Speed and memory.** On a CPU a 640 px frame takes about two minutes for
  materials and three for geometry plus lighting, and the node needs about
  8 GB of free RAM (one model is held at a time). GPU timing is still to be
  measured on the RTX 4080.

### Example workflows

Seven workflows ship in the package's `workflows` folder. The first five
appear in ComfyUI's **Templates** browser under Radiance; any of them can also
be dragged onto the canvas. Each one was run on a clean install before release.
Pick your own file in the **Read** node; outputs go to
`ComfyUI/output/radiance_examples/`.

| Workflow | What it does | Models it needs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [`sdr_to_hdr`](workflows/sdr_to_hdr.json) | An 8-bit image or video to scene-linear HDR with SDR → HDR Universal, checked in the Viewer and saved as a 32-bit EXR. | The RUDRA model downloads itself (about 5 MB). |
| [`hdr_vae_encode_decode`](workflows/hdr_vae_encode_decode.json) | Carries a linear HDR plate through a VAE with VAE Encode (HDR) and VAE Decode (HDR), and compares the result with the original in the Viewer. | The VAE your model uses, in `models/vae`. |
| [`multipass_relight`](workflows/multipass_relight.json) | Multipass Estimate to a multilayer EXR of passes, and a point-light relight of the plate. | MoGe-2 and Marigold IID download themselves on first run (about 4.9 GB). |
| [`colour_grade`](workflows/colour_grade.json) | White Balance, Grade and an ASC CDL, checked in the Viewer and saved as a 16-bit TIFF. | None. |
| [`hdr_delivery`](workflows/hdr_delivery.json) | One scene-linear master to an EXR archive, a tagged HDR10 (PQ, Rec.2020) H.265 file and an ACES 2.0 SDR H.264 file. | None. |
| [`workflows/start.json`](workflows/start.json) | The quick start: Radiance Loader, Cinematic Prompt, Resolution, Sampler Pro, HDR VAE Decode and the viewers wired end to end for FLUX.1-dev. | [`flux1-dev.safetensors`](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev) and `ae.safetensors` from the same page (accept the licence first) in `models/diffusion_models` and `models/vae`; [`clip_l.safetensors`](https://huggingface.co/comfyanonymous/flux_text_encoders/resolve/main/clip_l.safetensors) and [`t5xxl_fp16.safetensors`](https://huggingface.co/comfyanonymous/flux_text_encoders/resolve/main/t5xxl_fp16.safetensors) in `models/text_encoders` |
| [`workflows/official/wan22_t2v_hdr_universal.json`](workflows/official/wan22_t2v_hdr_universal.json) | Wan 2.2 text-to-video through SDR → HDR Universal to an HDR master with HDR Encode and Write. | [`wan2.2_t2v_high_noise_14B_fp8_scaled`](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Wan_2.2_ComfyUI_Repackaged/resolve/main/split_files/diffusion_models/wan2.2_t2v_high_noise_14B_fp8_scaled.safetensors) and [`wan2.2_t2v_low_noise_14B_fp8_scaled`](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Wan_2.2_ComfyUI_Repackaged/resolve/main/split_files/diffusion_models/wan2.2_t2v_low_noise_14B_fp8_scaled.safetensors) in `models/diffusion_models`; [`umt5_xxl_fp8_e4m3fn_scaled`](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Wan_2.1_ComfyUI_repackaged/resolve/main/split_files/text_encoders/umt5_xxl_fp8_e4m3fn_scaled.safetensors) in `models/text_encoders`; [`wan_2.1_vae`](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Wan_2.2_ComfyUI_Repackaged/resolve/main/split_files/vae/wan_2.1_vae.safetensors) in `models/vae`. The RUDRA model downloads itself. |

## Quick start

**Generate in HDR.** Drag [`workflows/start.json`](workflows/start.json) onto
the canvas, pick your FLUX.1-dev files in the Loader (see
[Example workflows](#example-workflows) for the downloads), and queue. VAE
Decode (HDR) is in Direct HDR mode, so the Viewer shows a scene-linear HDR
frame; save it with **Write** as EXR.

**Turn an existing image or video into HDR.**

1. **Read** your image, video or sequence.
2. Add **SDR → HDR Universal**. The defaults are a sensible HDR10 master:
   `Hybrid`, 1,000-nit peak, 203-nit reference white. The first run downloads
   the RUDRA model (about 5 MB).
3. For an EXR, leave `output_encoding` on `Linear` and **Write** EXR. For HDR10
   delivery, set it to `PQ (HDR10)` and Write a 10-bit or higher format.
4. Wire the `report` output to a preview to see what ran, including whether
   learned recovery was applied.

**Look at HDR properly.** Feed any image into the **Viewer**. It knows what the
pixels are (scene-linear, sRGB, PQ, log) and applies the display transform, so
nothing is clipped or double-converted on screen.

## What it does

### Reading and writing

Read opens images, EXRs, video and numbered sequences from any absolute path, including UNC and mapped drives. It works out what a path is from the extension and the pattern, so `/renders/shot.%04d.exr`, `/frames/####.png` and a bare directory all resolve to a sequence. Open one frame of a sequence and it offers you the whole range.

Video decodes through a single raw ffmpeg pipe at the source's own bit depth. 10, 12 and 16-bit survive. ProRes 4444 alpha comes out on the mask output, frame ranges are exact rather than approximate, and the container's colour tags are read instead of assumed. The `info` output is a JSON wire carrying resolution, frame count and range, bit depth, codec, EXR layers and windows, colour tags and timecode. Nuke's metadata tab, as something you can plug into.

Write covers PNG 8 and 16-bit, JPEG, TIFF 16 and 32-float, DPX, WebP, Radiance HDR, EXR half and float, H.264, H.265 10-bit, ProRes 422 and 4444, DNxHR, and numbered sequences of any of the still formats. It shows you the path that will actually land on disk before you run it, assembled by the same code that does the writing. `overwrite` is off by default; an existing file gets a unique suffix rather than being replaced.

### Colour

Load a show's OCIO config and the Display and View menus come from it. Nothing is re-implemented: the transform is OCIO's own, applied through its generated GPU shader in the Viewer. With no config loaded, the built-in ACES 1.3 pipeline runs as before. OCIO is a capability here, not a dependency.

The grading nodes are the ones you would expect from a compositing package. Grade, Grade Match, CDL, Curves, Hue Curves, White Balance, LUT Apply and Blend, Colour Space Convert, and a QC pass. Sixteen colour spaces, including the camera logs (ARRI LogC3 and LogC4, Sony S-Log3, Panasonic V-Log, Canon Log 3, RED Log3G10, DaVinci Intermediate), plus PQ, HLG, ACEScg and ACEScct.

Both ACES 2.0 tone scales are implemented against the published Output Transform table.

### HDR

Log encoding happens before the VAE, not after it, and the Compress Log profiles are clamp-free from decode through to the file. Highlights above 1.0 reach disk. That is the claim the package is built on and there is a test that writes negatives and values up to 64.0 through EXR and TIFF and requires them back exactly.

VAE Encode (HDR) and VAE Decode (HDR) are a pair. Encode log-codes a scene-linear image and stamps the latent; Decode in Auto inverts that exactly, so values above 1.0 survive the VAE (measured through the SD VAE: highlights within 0.03 stops, 97% of the range above 1.0 kept). A latent a sampler has touched is decoded sampler-safe, identical to ComfyUI's own VAE Decode, and Direct HDR on it reconstructs clipped highlights with the RUDRA model. Learned recovery of clipped highlights and crushed shadows is the job of SDR → HDR Universal and SDR → HDR Recover, which run the RUDRA pixel model on any image or frame batch, no VAE required; the weights download on first use (see Models above).

There is also HDR LoRA loading and application, a LoRA stack with per-LoRA model and CLIP strengths, tone mapping, HDR synthesis, and relighting.

### The Viewer

FP32 and RGBA32F end to end, on WebGL2.

A switch in the Viewer's title bar picks **Simple** or **Advanced**. Simple is the picture, a transport and compare, nothing else. Advanced adds the menus, tool rail, scopes, grade, inspector and timeline tools. A new Viewer opens in Simple; the choice is saved with the node, and a graph saved before the switch existed opens in Advanced, as it looked.

Compare works the same in both modes: **A**, **B**, **Wipe** (drag the line), **Diff** (|A − B| × 4) and **Blink** (flips A and B twice a second). B is the node's `compare_image`, following the playhead. With nothing connected, **Pin A as B** keeps the current frame as B, and it stays through new runs: pin, change the graph, queue, compare. **Release B** goes back to the input.

Scopes: histogram, waveform, vectorscope and parade. You pick the scale (10 or 12-bit code value, percent, millivolts, or nits for ST.2084 and HLG) and data or video levels, and whether the scopes measure before or after the viewer's colour transforms. Every graticule line carries its number.

The pixel probe samples a cursor, a region or the whole frame, and reports RGBA, luminance, EV, cd/m², HSV and hex, with min, max, mean and median per channel. NaN, Inf and negative counts are excluded from the statistics and reported separately, because a mean that quietly includes a NaN is worse than no mean.

Then the things you reach for while looking: false colour, zebra, a nit-accurate HDR heatmap anchored to BT.2408 reference white, safe areas labelled with the standard they come from, aspect-ratio mattes, nearest-neighbour magnification, timecode, A/B compare with wipe, difference and blink, EXR channel and layer inspection, focus peaking, and a sequence timeline with per-frame thumbnails.

The Lite Viewer node is gone: Simple mode does its job. A graph saved with a Lite Viewer opens with a Viewer in its place, in Simple mode, with the same connections and `input_space` / `fps`.

| Key | Action |

| Space | Play / pause |
| Left / Right | Previous / next frame |
| F | Fit to view |
| 1 | 1:1 pixels |
| J / K / L | Play backwards / stop / play forwards |
| I / O | In / out point (Alt+X clears) |
| C / R / G / B / Y / A | Colour, red, green, blue, luma, alpha |
| W | Waveform |
| V | Vectorscope |
| X | Wipe compare on / off |
| N | Nearest-neighbour / linear |

### VFX

Plate prep, masks, depth, optics, motion, and multipass. Motion estimation is DIS optical flow, which stays dense out to about 20 px of movement; the older Lucas–Kanade solver is still selectable. Multipass Estimate predicts passes from a plate with trained models (MoGe-2 geometry, Marigold materials and lighting); when you have real AOVs, the Multipass AOV Reader takes a multilayer EXR. Relighting works off either.

### Video

Loader, prompt builder, sampler, text-to-video, image-to-video, routing, batch decode and export. Upscaling is available for stills and for video, with HDR and colour-encoding options so scene-linear input survives a backend that works in display space.

### Studio dashboards

Three of them, opened from the Project Manager node. They render over the ComfyUI graph rather than in another tab, and close with Esc.

| Dashboard | What it holds |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Project Manager** | Shows, sequences and shots, with a WIP / Review / Approved / Retake pipeline, version history, a shot panel, project storage and recent outputs, read from your saved workflows. |
| **Workflow Library** | Search, preview and load saved workflows back into the canvas, organised into bins. |
| **Assets** | Scans the ComfyUI input and output folders, sorts images, video and sequences (grouped by frame range), and gives you bins, filters, search, drag-and-drop import and a detail panel. |

### Things that make the graph easier to live with

The Sampler shows nothing until you pick a preset, everything in Custom, and only the parameters that matter to the model you named. Read plays MP4, MOV and WebM on the node with scrubbing, and falls back to a first-frame poster for codecs the browser cannot decode. Group nodes get a tinted backdrop keyed to category instead of a near-invisible panel. And any selection of nodes can be collapsed into a Gizmo: one node, saved and reloaded like any other.

## Node map

Everything lives under one menu.

```text
FXTD STUDIOS/Radiance

```

**156 nodes**: 147 in the menu and 9 retired ones that stay registered so older saved graphs still open. A few depend on optional packages.

Compositing nodes use compositing names (`Grade`, `CDL`, `OCIO ColorSpace`, `Defocus`, `Viewer`, `Read`, `Write`), so they read the way they do in Nuke or Flame. The diffusion layer keeps a `Radiance` prefix, so `Radiance Sampler` and `Radiance VAE Decode` are obviously the AI ones. Typing "radiance" in the search still finds everything.

The [node reference](docs/nodes/README.md) lists every node with every input
(type, default, range and what it does) and every output. It is generated from
the nodes themselves, and ComfyUI shows the same text on hover.

## DCC Handoff

### Nuke

Send to Nuke writes EXR frames and a `.nk` Read node next to them. With
`push_to_nuke` on it also creates (or updates) that Read node in a running
Nuke and shows it in the Viewer. Start the listener once per Nuke session, in
the Script Editor:

```python
exec(open("/path/to/ComfyUI/custom_nodes/radiance/scripts/start_nuke_server.py").read())
```

It adds a Radiance menu (Start / Stop Bridge, Queue Last Run, Cinematic
Encoder). The listener binds to `127.0.0.1` and accepts only signed,
structured actions. The signing key is found the same way on both sides:
`RADIANCE_DCC_AUTH_TOKEN` if set, otherwise `~/.radiance/dcc_token`, created
automatically the first time either side needs it, so on one machine nothing
has to be configured. For Nuke on another machine, copy that file there (or
set the variable on both) and set `RADIANCE_NUKE_BIND_HOST` in Nuke and
`RADIANCE_NUKE_HOST` in ComfyUI.

### DaVinci Resolve

Send to DaVinci Resolve writes 16-bit TIFF, 8-bit PNG or EXR into a folder.
With `import_to_media_pool` on it also imports them into the open project's
Media Pool (a numbered batch comes in as one clip), through Resolve's own
scripting API: Resolve must be running on the same machine with Preferences >
System > General > External scripting using set to Local. Resolve's scripting
module is found at its standard install path, or through `RESOLVE_SCRIPT_API`.

Both nodes have an `input_space` setting: EXR is written scene-linear and TIFF
/ PNG as sRGB display images, converting what comes in. `As is` (the default)
writes the values unchanged.

## Settings

Radiance works with no configuration. These environment variables change its
behaviour; set them where you start ComfyUI and restart it.

| Variable | What it does |
| :--- | :--- |
| `RADIANCE_ALLOW_DOWNLOADS` | Models download on first use by default. `0` never downloads any model; a missing one stops the node with the file name, size and folder to install it by hand. |
| `HF_TOKEN` | Hugging Face read token, used for the gated repositories (FLUX.2-dev, FLUX.2-klein 9B, LTX-2.5) once their licence is accepted. `huggingface-cli login` works too. |
| `HF_HUB_OFFLINE`, `TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE` | `1` treats the machine as offline; nothing is downloaded. |
| `RADIANCE_SDR2HDR_PIXEL` | Path to a specific RUDRA SDR → HDR checkpoint. |
| `RADIANCE_TEMPORAL_RUDRA` | Path to a temporal RUDRA checkpoint for ordered video. |
| `OCIO` | Your studio's OpenColorIO config. Without it Radiance uses OpenColorIO's built-in ACES studio config. |
| `RADIANCE_OCIO_ROOTS` | Extra folders the OCIO nodes may load configs and LUTs from (`;` on Windows, `:` elsewhere). |
| `RADIANCE_READ_ROOTS` | Extra folders the Read node may *preview* from, such as a NAS or UNC share. Reading any path works without it. |
| `RADIANCE_FFMPEG` | Path to the ffmpeg to use. Otherwise the one on `PATH`, then the bundled imageio-ffmpeg. |
| `RADIANCE_LOG_LEVEL` | `DEBUG` for full tracebacks in the console when something fails. |
| `RADIANCE_DCC_AUTH_TOKEN` | Shared key for the Nuke connection. Unset: both sides use `~/.radiance/dcc_token`, created automatically. |

Models go in `ComfyUI/models/radiance` (MoGe in `models/geometry_estimation`); a `radiance:` entry in
`extra_model_paths.yaml` adds more folders.

## Troubleshooting

- **The log says fewer than 156 nodes loaded.** A module failed to import. The
  lines above it name the module and the error, and the Environment Guard
  table shows which package is missing. Reinstall the requirements into
  ComfyUI's own Python (for the Windows portable build:
  `python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install -r ComfyUI\custom_nodes\radiance\requirements.txt`).
- **SDR → HDR says "learned recovery: NOT APPLIED".** The model is not
  installed and could not be downloaded (offline, `RADIANCE_ALLOW_DOWNLOADS=0`,
  or no write access to `models/radiance`). The console gives the direct
  download link; put the file in `ComfyUI/models/radiance/`. The node still
  outputs a correct deterministic HDR expansion meanwhile.
- **HDR looks clipped or washed out in a normal image preview.** Standard
  preview nodes show values above 1.0 as white. Use the Viewer, or write an
  EXR / PQ file and check it in an HDR-aware application.
- **An EXR will not read or write.** Check the Environment Guard table for
  OpenEXR and OpenImageIO. On Python 3.14 OpenEXR is not installed yet and
  OpenImageIO is used instead.
- **Colours look different after upgrading from ≤ 3.2.0.** See
  [Notes & Tips](#notes--tips); older versions skipped some colour-space
  conversions.
- **Anything else:** open an issue with the startup log (from the Radiance
  Environment Guard table down) and the node's `report` or `metadata` output.

## Known limitations

Kept here rather than in a tracker, because a control that quietly does nothing
is worse than one that says so. Full detail in the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

- **The ACES 2.0 tone scale is not the Daniele Evo curve.** It is a log-space
  contrast of 1.55 with a tanh shoulder, so 18% grey sits about 0.84 stop above
  the ACES 2.0 reference on SDR, and HLG diffuse white lands at signal 0.915
  rather than 0.75. The normalisation defects around it were fixed in 3.2.0;
  the curve itself has not been replaced yet. Grade by eye against a reference,
  not by trusting the label.
- **`blend_mode = "laplacian_pyramid"`** falls back to the Gaussian feather.
  `"linear"` and `"gaussian_feather"` are genuinely different.
- **`chromatic_adaptation` has no effect.** The white-point adaptation is baked
  into the precomputed conversion matrices.
- **Optical flow holds to about 20 px of motion per frame.** Beyond roughly
  28 px every solver here loses the correspondence. The Lucas–Kanade fallback
  degrades earlier (well before 20 px on fine detail); prefer the default DIS
  solver. Measurements are in [KNOWN_ISSUES.md](KNOWN_ISSUES.md).

- **No SAM runtime.** `SAM Loader` and `SAM Mask Generator` are hidden and
  raise when executed; they never ran a segmentation model. Use a SAM2 node
  pack and feed its MASK into Radiance's matting and propagation nodes.
- **Upscale `confidence` is a tile weight.** It is 1 at tile centres and lower
  toward tile edges; no backend reports per-pixel hallucination.
- **Multipass Estimate is an estimate.** Its passes come from models trained
  to predict them, but they are predictions from one image: metric scale is
  approximate, materials are what the model infers, and video is estimated
  per frame, so expect some flicker. Details in [KNOWN_ISSUES.md](KNOWN_ISSUES.md).
- **CFG schedules are static.** The video pipelines use the first value of
  `cfg_schedule_json` as the CFG; it does not vary per step.

## Notes & Tips

- **Estimated VFX passes.** Multipass Estimate predicts passes from a single image with trained models, handy for 2D and generated footage, but not a substitute for true render passes. For ground-truth passes, feed a multilayer EXR through the Multipass AOV Reader.
- **Super-resolution and color.** Upscale backends work in display-referred space. For scene-linear input, use the upscaler's HDR and color-encoding options to preserve your values.
- **Previews from a NAS or server path.** The Read node opens any absolute path (local, mapped drive, UNC), but its inline preview/info widgets are served over unauthenticated HTTP routes restricted to ComfyUI's own folders. To preview media elsewhere, allow those roots explicitly (`;`-separated on Windows) and restart ComfyUI:

  ```bat
  setx RADIANCE_READ_ROOTS "Z:\renders;\\server\share\plates"
  ```

- **Upgrading from ≤ 3.2.0: re-check graded masters.** `RadianceColorSpaceConvert` previously performed no conversion at all for 10 of its 16 spaces (all camera-log and ACES working spaces) whenever no OCIO config was loaded, which is the default install. Anything that passed through those conversions was graded on unconverted pixels. Details in the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).
