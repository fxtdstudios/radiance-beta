#: Floor for the number of nodes the entry point is expected to publish.
#:
#: `load_node_mappings` treats a failed optional import as non-fatal so a broken
#: dependency can never stop ComfyUI from starting. The cost is that a group
#: import failure silently removes every node in that group, and the startup
#: banner reported the surviving count as a success -- "successfully loaded 12
#: nodes" reads exactly like "successfully loaded 100 nodes" in a scrolling log.
#: Comparing against this floor turns that into a visible ERROR.
#:
#: Raise it when the catalog grows; a drop below it means something failed to
#: import, not that the catalog shrank.
#:
#: This is the ONLY floor. It used to read 129 against 131 actually
#: registering, while tests/test_package_cleanup.py asserted >= 129 of its own
#: and tests/test_node_smoke.py asserted >= 85 -- three numbers, none of them
#: the truth, and a two-node slack in which a node could stop registering with
#: every count test still green. Both tests read this constant now, so the
#: floor moves in one place and nothing hides underneath it.
#:
#: 2026-09-18: 131 -> 156. Twenty-six nodes the implementation packages
#: declared and no group registered; twenty-five of them ship, and
#: RadianceHDRHistogram is withheld for a 5-D IMAGE output. See
#: nodes/catalog.py and tests/test_node_publication_completeness.py.
#: 2026-09-24: 156 -> 157. RadianceHDRVAEEncode, the encoder HDR VAE Decode
#: inverts, implemented as RadianceVAE4KEncode but never registered.
