# ── Putting the two methods on one scale ─────────────────────────────────────
#
# `_histogram_diff` and `_edge_diff` measured different things in different
# units. The histogram distance is an L1 distance between two normalised
# distributions, so it spans 0..2 by construction and a hard cut sits somewhere
# above ~0.3. The edge distance was a mean absolute difference of gradient
# magnitudes, which in practice never left the bottom tenth of its range — and
# which moved with the footage's contrast rather than with the cut, so it had
# no fixed scale even on its own. That part is fixed in `_edge_diff` itself;
# what follows makes the two comparable to each other.
#
# One `threshold` widget therefore could not mean the same thing for both, and
# `combined` was worse than either: 0.6 * histogram + 0.4 * edge added two
# quantities with no common unit, so the nominal "40% edge" contribution was in
# reality a couple of percent, and the blend was a histogram detector wearing a
# hat.
#
# Each raw distance is now divided by the distance that method reports for a
# textbook hard cut, then squashed with r/(1+r) into a bounded confidence in
# [0, 1) where 0.5 means "as different as a hard cut". The squash is strictly
# monotonic, so nothing is clipped away and the score plot keeps its full
# dynamic range — unlike a min(x, 1) clamp, which would flatten every strong
# cut to the same bar.
#
# HISTOGRAM_CUT_REFERENCE is the cut point this node has always documented for
# that method, carried over unchanged.
#
# EDGE_CUT_REFERENCE is new. The tooltip's old figure of 0.15 could not survive
# `_edge_diff` becoming scale-free (see its docstring), and it did not describe
# the old metric either — measured across smooth, mid-detail, detailed and
# hard-edged synthetic plates, real cuts on the old absolute metric landed
# between 0.003 and 0.069, so 0.15 declared every cut a non-cut. 0.30 is the
# median relative distance between unrelated frames across those same plates,
# against a within-shot median of 0.07 for grain, small pans and exposure
# ramps.
#
# Both are the whole calibration and nothing else depends on their being right;
# recalibrating either is a one-line change with `TestTheScalesAreComparable`
# to check it against.

    repair: the score scales with the frames' own contrast and texture energy,

    Dividing by the total edge energy of both frames — a Bray–Curtis
    dissimilarity — removes the dependence exactly, as the third column shows,

    Known limitation, and the reason `combined` is the default rather than
    `edge`: this method still cannot see a cut between two frames that both
    lack edges (a soft gradient cutting to a different soft gradient, or black
    cutting to white), and heavy grain still moves it more than a subtle cut
    does. `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` carries the details.
