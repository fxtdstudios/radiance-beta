"""Publishing a node is the default; withholding one has to be written down.

Every node group is a package of leaf modules, each declaring its own
``NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS``, and each group's ``__init__.py`` then hand-copied a
selection of those keys into the group mapping that ComfyUI actually reads.
Nothing checked the two against each other, so a node was published only if a
human remembered to add a second line in a second file after writing it.

Seventeen did not get that line. They were finished — real classes, working
``INPUT_TYPES``, tooltips, tests in some cases — and they had never once
appeared in anyone's menu:

    RadianceHDRTurboEncoder, RadianceHDRPerChannelNorm,
    RadianceHDRPerChannelDenorm, RadianceACESMetadataFile,
    RadianceACES2Compliance, RadianceColorSpaceInfo,
    RadianceLuminanceGuidance, RadianceHDRBlendValidator, RadianceHDRAnalysis,
    RadianceNDISender, RadianceShotGradeRouter, RadianceAudioCut,
    RadianceAudioTranscribe, RadianceLinearCheck, RadianceCinemaStudio,
    RadianceCameraSync, RadianceVideoPromptBuilder

That is the same defect as issue #40 (a sampler feature no node could reach)
and as RadianceGradeApply (a viewer node whose only trace was an entry in
`SECTION_OVERRIDES`), and finding it a third time by hand is not a strategy.

`fold_in_module_nodes` inverts the default. A group's ``__init__.py`` keeps its
explicit mapping — that stays the readable index of what the group is, and an
explicit entry always wins — and then calls this to sweep its own package for
anything it missed. Adding a node to a leaf module is now enough to ship it.

Withholding is still possible and now has to be deliberate: name the key in a
module-level ``WITHHELD_NODES`` set, with a comment saying why.
