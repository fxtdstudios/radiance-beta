"""
io/reader.py — the read engine, with no node layer above it.

This is `RadianceRead`'s body and every decoder under it, moved down a floor,
the same way `io/writer.py` was. Nothing here knows what a ComfyUI node is, and
nothing here imports one.

## Why it moved

`nodes/io/write.py` was 2972 lines and came down to 2201 when the write engine
left. What remained was the reader, and it was the larger half of the problem:
the decoders are the part other things want. `nodes/pipeline/dcc.py` and
`nodes/pipeline/studio_integrations.py` both reach into the node module for
`_read_sequence` and `_load_video_to_numpy` — sideways imports into a module
whose real job is to declare two ComfyUI nodes — and the writer could not take
`coerce_to_frames` all the way down precisely because resolving a path to
frames meant reading media, which lived up here.

So: the decoders, the colour-space decode, the path-kind detection, the image,
sequence and video readers, the write-input coercion helpers and the UI probe
all move to `radiance/io/reader.py`. `nodes/io/write.py` imports them straight
back under their old private names, so `RadianceRead`, `RadianceEXRMultiPart`,
`RadianceDigitalCinemaRead` and the HTTP routes are untouched by the move, and
`RadianceRead.read` becomes a signature and a delegation.

## What stayed up

The browse widget. `_get_input_files` and `_resolve_browse` translate a
filename in ComfyUI's input directory into a path, which needs `folder_paths`
— the one genuinely node-layer thing in the reader. `read_frames` therefore
takes a path and nothing else; the node resolves `browse` first and hands the
result down. That is the mirror image of the writer's `read_media` callback,
and it is the whole of the coupling.

There is no lazy upward import hiding in a function body here;
`radiance.io.reader` depends on nothing above it, which is checkable rather
than promised — see tests/test_reader_layering.py.
