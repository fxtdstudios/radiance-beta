io/writer.py — the write engine, with no node layer above it.

This is `RadianceWrite`'s body, moved down a floor. Nothing here knows what a
ComfyUI node is, and nothing here imports one.

## Why it moved

`delivery/handler.py` used to do `from radiance.nodes.io.write import
RadianceWrite`, instantiate the node, and call `.write()` on it. The delivery
path reaching up into the node layer is backwards, and it had a concrete cost:
the handler could not be exercised without importing ComfyUI's node surface,
so the one thing that decides whether a master lands on disk correctly was the
one thing hardest to test.

The stated reason it could not move was that `RadianceWrite.write` is 118 lines
leaning on module-level helpers in the same 2972-line file. That was true, and
it is what this file is: the helpers came too. `nodes/io/write.py` imports them
straight back under their old private names, so `RadianceEXRMultiPart`,
`RadianceDigitalCinemaWrite` and the reader are untouched, and
`RadianceWrite.write` is now a signature and a delegation.

## The one thing that did not come down

`coerce_to_frames` accepts a file path or a VideoHelperSuite-style dict, and
resolving either means *reading* media -- several hundred lines of decoder that
belong to the reader, a floor up. Rather than drag the reader down or import it
upward, the reader is passed in: `read_media` is a callable the node layer
supplies and the delivery path does not, because the delivery path hands the
writer a tensor. Given a path and no reader, the error says so.

That is the whole of the layering. There is no lazy upward import hiding in a
function body here; `radiance.io.writer` depends on nothing above it, which is
checkable rather than promised — see tests/test_writer_layering.py.

## The other thing this file is: one frame at a time

Nothing here used to stream, and the cost was that the longest shot Radiance
could write was a property of how much RAM the machine had. Per 1920x1080
float32 RGB frame (24.9 MB) a video write held the source batch, `out_frames`,
the `np.stack` of it, and the raw byte string handed to ffmpeg, all at once:
measured, about 2000 frames at 1080p and 500 at 4K. `out_frames` was the
nastiest of the four, because under "Linear (pass-through)" it held views and
looked free, and under any active transform it held a second full copy, so
turning on a colour transform halved the maximum sequence length with nothing
in the UI to say so.

The shape now is:

    frames (any iterable)
      -> transform_stream()     a generator: colour, clamp, alpha, one frame
      -> dispatch_write()       consumes it, writes, releases, next

`dispatch_write` takes an iterable rather than a list, and the video branch
feeds ffmpeg's stdin as frames arrive rather than stacking the clip and handing
over one buffer. `write_frames` still accepts a tensor, because that is what a
ComfyUI node has; the ceiling there is that tensor plus one working frame. A
caller that does not already hold the shot -- a read-transform-write pipeline
over `reader.iter_sequence_frames` -- holds only the working window, and the
sequence length is then bounded by the disk.

This is measured, not asserted: tests/test_write_streaming.py reports peak
resident set for a 32-frame write and a 512-frame write and requires the
difference to be flat.

    swscale's BT.601 default (which shifted every hue on a Rec.709 delivery),
    the file carries primaries / transfer / matrix tags, and ProRes 4444
    carries the mask as alpha.

    ALBABIT-FIX: frames used to go through an 8-bit PNG intermediate, so no
    "10-bit" format ever carried more than 8 bits of real precision. Now
    piped raw via stdin: ProRes 422 HQ/4444 get a genuine 16-bit source (the
    formats that benefit); H.264/H.265/DNxHR HQ stay 8-bit, since their
    "10-bit" is a codec/container property, not source precision.

    ALBABIT-FIX: `frames` used to be one (N,H,W,3) array that the caller built
    with `np.stack`, and the whole clip was then converted to raw bytes in one
    `.tobytes()` -- three simultaneous full copies of the sequence (the source
    batch, the stack, the byte string) before a single frame reached ffmpeg.
    Measured ceiling was about 2000 frames at 1080p. `frames` is now any
    iterable and each frame is converted and written on its own, so peak memory
    is the source frame plus one raw buffer regardless of length. That is what
    a pipe is for.

    ALBABIT-FIX: the encode ran under a hardcoded `timeout=600`, which killed
    long masters mid-file and, because `-y` had already truncated the previous
    version, left neither the old master nor a complete new one. `timeout` now
    defaults to None (no limit), matching the decode side, which made the same
    change for the same reason -- see `core/video.py:decode`. When a caller
    does set a cap and it fires, the partial file is removed rather than left
    looking like a delivery.

    ALBABIT-FIX: stderr was captured by `subprocess.run(capture_output=True)`
    and then discarded, so every encode failure surfaced as a bare exit status
    with no reason. It is drained on a thread and quoted in the exception.
