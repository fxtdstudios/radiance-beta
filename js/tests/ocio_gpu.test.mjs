/**
 * The OpenColorIO display transform, on a GPU.
 *
 * `ocio.test.mjs` proves the config is read and the maths is OpenColorIO's.
 * That is not the same as proving the viewer *shows* it: between the two sits a
 * shader splice, a LUT upload and a texture-unit assignment, none of which Node
 * can exercise. This drives `glharness.html` in headless Chromium, compiles the
 * real spliced shader, uploads the real LUT textures, renders known pixels and
 * compares the GPU's answer to OpenColorIO's own CPU answer for the same
 * transform.
 *
 * It earned its place immediately. On the first run it found two defects that
 * every other form of checking had passed over, because both produced a
 * *plausible* result rather than an error:
 *
 *   1. Scene-linear black came back as 1.3e16, 7.7e14 or NaN depending on the
 *      display. GLSL leaves `pow(x, y)` undefined for x == 0, y <= 0, and
 *      OCIO's inverse-EOTF chains reach exactly that. Black is the most common
 *      pixel in a frame.
 *   2. Every HDR view rendered solid black. 32-bit float textures are not
 *      filterable in WebGL2 unless `OES_texture_float_linear` is *enabled*, and
 *      listing it in `getSupportedExtensions()` does not enable it. LINEAR
 *      sampling of an unfilterable R32F LUT silently returns zero — no error,
 *      no warning, clean compile.
 *
 * Both are pinned below.
 *
 * Playwright is not a dependency of this package, so these skip rather than
 * fail when it is absent. A skipped GPU test is visible in the output; a
 * missing one is not.
 *
 * Run: node --test js/tests/ocio_gpu.test.mjs
