/**
 * The grade maths, on a GPU.
 *
 * `radiance_grade.js` emits GLSL and WGSL from the same file as its JS
 * functions. That removes the *opportunity* for the backends to disagree — it
 * does not prove the transliteration is right. This compiles the emitted GLSL
 * in a real WebGL2 context and compares it to the JS across the grade settings
 * a user can actually reach, including the ones the old unguarded paths turned
 * into Infinity or NaN.
 *
 * **The WGSL half is not covered.** This container's Chromium has no
 * `navigator.gpu`, so the WebGPU shader cannot be compiled here at all.
 * `grade.test.mjs` holds the two dialects to the same set of functions
 * structurally, which is weaker. Saying so is the point: a gap that is written
 * down is a known gap, and one that is quietly skipped is a surprise later.
 *
 * Skips when Playwright is unavailable — a skipped GPU test is visible in the
 * output, a missing one is not.
 *
 * Run: node --test js/tests/grade_gpu.test.mjs
