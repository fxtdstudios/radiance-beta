"""Functional smoke test: actually CALL every node.

`test_node_smoke.py` checks that each node *declares* itself correctly —
INPUT_TYPES parses, RETURN_TYPES exists, FUNCTION names a real method, the class
instantiates. It never calls anything. A node can pass all of that and raise on
the first line of its FUNCTION.

This module closes that gap. For every key in NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS it:

  1. builds an argument set from the node's own INPUT_TYPES — real tensors for
     IMAGE/MASK/LATENT, declared defaults for scalars, the first option for
     combos;
  2. calls FUNCTION;
  3. asserts the return is a tuple whose length matches RETURN_TYPES, and that
     IMAGE/MASK outputs have the shape and dtype ComfyUI requires;
  4. asserts the input tensors were not mutated in place — ComfyUI hands the
     same tensor to every consumer of a link, so an in-place write corrupts
     other branches of the graph.

A node that needs something this harness cannot synthesise — a MODEL, a VAE, a
file on disk, a GPU — SKIPS with that reason stated. A skip is a known gap; a
pass is a node that demonstrably runs. Neither is silent.

# str(exc), and it swallowed real bugs. Free text cannot separate "this machine
# lacks a model file" from "this node has an argument-contract bug", and no
# wording change makes it able to. Four fabricated bug messages, four skips:
#
#   ValueError("mask requires the same batch size as image")  -> "requires"

#      an ImportError for a module that genuinely will not import, a
#      FileNotFoundError, or an AttributeError against one of conftest's stub
#      modules. A node computing a wrong tile size raises none of these.
#   2. _ENVIRONMENT_GATED -- an explicit, per-node predicate that interrogates
#      this environment and returns a reason, or None to let the failure stand.
#      Four entries, each one a named function you can read.
