"""The twenty-six nodes that were finished, tested, and invisible.

Four top-level packages -- `radiance.image`, `radiance.hdr`, `radiance.film`
and `radiance.color` -- each declare a full NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS in their
`__init__.py`. None of them is a node group (see nodes/catalog.py), and
`fold_in_module_nodes` walks only the `__path__` of a package already in the
catalog, so nothing in the load chain ever read those dicts. Three more nodes
were missing from their own leaf module's mapping, which is the one place the
sweep does look.

Twenty-six complete classes, with INPUT_TYPES, tooltips and in several cases
their own tests, that no user could put on a graph. Twenty-five of them ship
now; RadianceHDRHistogram emits a 5-D IMAGE and is withheld with its reason in
tests/test_node_publication_completeness.py, because publishing a node whose
output ComfyUI cannot render is not publishing it.

`tests/test_node_publication_completeness.py` is the guard that makes the class
of bug fail the suite. This file pins the specific fix: each node registered,
pointing at the class it is supposed to point at, in a declared menu section,
with a label. Every assertion here fails against the pre-fix catalog.
