"""Exact frame counts, at every length, on every codec Radiance reads back.

The README claims "frame counts are exact from 1 to 100 frames across H.264,
H.265 10-bit and ProRes". Nothing tested that. `test_video_read.py` pins a
single `FRAMES = 8` and asserts a frame count in two places, both ProRes; the
H.264 fixture there has no frame-count assertion at all, and H.265 10-bit is
never encoded in that file, its only appearance being a `test_writes_without_
crash` that asserts a file exists. A decoder that dropped the last frame of a
long-GOP clip, or handed back one frame too many at a keyframe boundary, would
have shipped green.

This file is the sweep the claim describes. Each fixture frame carries its own
index as a 7-bit bar code across the width, so the assertions are not just
"how many frames came back" but "which frames, in what order": a duplicated,
dropped, reordered or repeated-last frame is caught by value, not by a
tolerance on a ramp. The default sweep covers the lengths where off-by-one
errors live; the exhaustive 1-to-100 version is marked `slow`.

The whole module skips when ffmpeg is absent, and an individual codec skips
when this ffmpeg build cannot encode it, the same way test_video_read.py does.

# Frame f is encoded as a 7-bit bar code: bit b is a BAR_WIDTH-wide white

#: bit depth). The GOP is pinned at 12 on both inter-frame codecs so the
