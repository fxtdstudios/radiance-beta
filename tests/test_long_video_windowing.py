tests/test_long_video_windowing.py
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Overlapping temporal windows for long-video sampling, and the noise
bookkeeping that windowing sits on top of.

WHAT THESE TESTS ESTABLISH
  • The window plan covers every frame, exactly once at full weight, with the
    first window on frame 0 and the last on the final frame.
  • The blend weights are a partition of unity across every overlap, before
    any normalisation, and are strictly positive everywhere (the black-frame
    failure mode RadianceUpscaleVideo already had to fix).
  • Blending happens PER STEP: the recombination runs inside the denoising
    loop, once per model evaluation, not once per finished window.
  • Callback and step accounting are untouched by windowing: same number of
    callbacks, same step indices, same total.
  • Peak working-set size is a function of the window, not of clip length.
  • The plan is deterministic, so a rerun at the same seed produces the same
    windows.
  • A single window reproduces the unwindowed result BIT-EXACTLY.

WHAT THESE TESTS CANNOT ESTABLISH
  There is no GPU and no diffusion model in this environment. The fake
  denoiser is an arithmetic stand-in, so nothing here says the output is
  TEMPORALLY COHERENT on a real video model: whether a window boundary is
  invisible in a rendered plate, whether content drifts across a long clip,
  and what window/overlap values a given architecture actually needs are all
  questions only a real render on real hardware answers. That validation is
  the operator's, on the 4080.
