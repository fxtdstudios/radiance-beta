"""The write path streams, and the ceiling is the working window.

Nothing in the write path used to stream. Per 1920x1080 float32 RGB frame
(24.9 MB) these were simultaneously resident:

    RadianceWrite -> VID   `frames` + `out_frames` + `np.stack` + raw bytes
    RadianceWrite -> SEQ   `frames` + `out_frames`
    RadianceRead sequence  a list of N tensors + `torch.cat`

so the maximum length of a shot was a property of how much RAM the box had,
measured at roughly 2000 frames at 1080p and 500 at 4K. Worse, `out_frames`
held *views* with `color_space="Linear (pass-through)"` and fresh allocations
the moment any transform was active, so turning on a colour transform halved
the maximum sequence length, silently.

A claim that code "streams" is not a test. These measure: each case runs in a
subprocess and reports `ru_maxrss`, the peak resident set the kernel actually
saw, for a short sequence and a long one. Flat means streaming. The old code
cannot even reach the measurement -- `dispatch_write` was typed
`List[np.ndarray]` and began with `len(frames)` -- which is itself the point.
