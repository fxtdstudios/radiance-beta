"""Every NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS in the distribution, not just the ones we remember.

This is the third time the same defect has shipped, and each time the test that
should have caught it was looking at a smaller part of the tree than the defect
was hiding in:

  * 2026-07, `tests/test_node_smoke.py` scanned only the root `nodes_*.py`
    layer, so retiring that layer made keys vanish from the scan rather than
    fail it;
  * 2026-08, `tests/test_node_publication.py` widened the scan to `nodes/`,
    which found seventeen finished nodes no group's `__init__.py` had ever
    listed. That scan still stops at `nodes/`, and skips `__init__.py` files;
  * 2026-09, twenty-three more, in `radiance/image`, `radiance/hdr` and
    `radiance/film`. Each declares a complete NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS in its
    `__init__.py`. They are not node groups (nodes/catalog.py), and
    `fold_in_module_nodes` cannot cross a package boundary, so nothing in the
    load chain has ever read a single one of those dicts.

So this file scans the WHOLE package, every `.py` file including `__init__.py`,
and asserts two things about every mapping it finds: that the key reaches
ComfyUI, and that it reaches ComfyUI pointing at the class the mapping names.
The second half matters because `radiance/film/__init__.py` declares
RadianceFilmGrain and RadianceMotionBlur as classes that are NOT the ones
shipping under those keys -- a key-only check calls that published and moves on.

Nothing here is hand-listed. Writing a new node with a mapping entry and
forgetting to register it turns this suite red on the next run, whichever
package it was written in. A node may still be withheld, by naming it in its
module's WITHHELD_NODES or in one of the two allow-lists below, and an
allow-list entry is a sentence explaining the decision, not a key.
