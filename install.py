"""ComfyUI-Manager runs this after installing Radiance.

It makes sure the two libraries Radiance's colour pipeline is built on are
present: OpenEXR (EXR read/write) and OpenColorIO (colour management). Once
they are, there is nothing to configure: at startup Radiance uses your $OCIO
if you have one, otherwise OpenColorIO's built-in ACES studio config, and
OpenCV's EXR codec is switched on (OPENCV_IO_ENABLE_OPENEXR=1).
